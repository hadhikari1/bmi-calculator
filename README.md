# BMI calculator in React using TypeScript:

1. User Story: Entering Measurements
  * As a user,
  * I want to be able to input my height (in centimeters or inches) and weight (in kilograms or pounds),
  * So that the application can calculate and display my Body Mass Index (BMI).

2. User Story: Viewing BMI Results
  * As a user,
  * I want to see my BMI result immediately after entering my valid measurements,
  * So that I can know my BMI category (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity) based on the calculated BMI.

3. User Story: Input Validation and Error Handling
  * As a user,
  * I want to be notified if I enter invalid or incomplete measurements (like letters instead of numbers, or leaving fields empty),
  * So that I can correct my input and ensure accurate BMI calculation.
